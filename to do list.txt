add ai functionality where user will log in in whatsapp and will send to our ai in our app to do something like list payroll, or create delete, ai will be via api open ai.
add filters in list pages 
implement load more pagination to list pages and in search dropdowns
payments page/side emails dont use business who is active in session that perfoms or own the payments authomations, in payroll this is done smoothly
add known admins pages and look in users dashboard, also add pages about system/app management pages
admin are not allowed in user app and users are not in admin pages and routes
Payments page pull all jobs in all businesses not in current switched to business that is in session, this is not payments problem payroll too i realised when you refresh the page it pulls data according to business but if click of menu link Payments page, payroll page maybe other pages too pull all jobs in all businesses not in current switched to business that is in session, or i think problem is somethimes when i switch while in payments page then go to payroll i realize it has switch back to last business i was when i was in payments page virse vurser to payroll page when i go to payemnt page

be like an business analyst and system designer, on the front end look to simplify user work flow, to make it easier for user, less clicks and run arounds

logo in emails is never shown instead i see image placeholder indicating no image was found

make admins dashboard, first read what they need in current project, admin files must be separate no file manipulation, admin can deactivate a business, block it or whatever

add notification in dashboard, they will come from admins
 no calculation or filtering execute done in php or front end, unless acceptable all that must happen in sql level
Brand web site public site (Swift pay- focus on service offered use catchy marketing terms)
On administrative there must be a page to view user business subscriptions

Now focus on security of the web app to be very secure (current rate limit implemented in employees login is weak it blocks legit users)

check efficiency (Build queries before get()  Let SQL do filtering/aggregation  Avoid pulling large datasets into PHP  Don’t loop models for computation)
optimize (Let SQL do the heavy lifting.  Offload slow work to queues.  Use PHP-FPM + proper worker tuning, optimize other code in the project i might not have mentioned)
Laravel/PHP handles each request in a worker, which runs synchronously. Slow tasks inside a request block only that worker, but other requests continue if other workers are free. 
To avoid blocking, you can offload heavy work to queues, run async HTTP requests, or use background processes. 
This makes the app effectively non-blocking from the user’s perspective while keeping Laravel fast and scalable for business workloads.

improve mcp server for ai

in front end make sure useeffects are used correctly the way they were mean to be used

location in login email is not there at all

reports page is not working

rules and use case design on payroll like 1 employee be in one reccuring payroll job, adjustments be be for current month so 
no problems can happen if employee get fired, i dont know im not saying these must be rules im no analyst or designer or business analyst
but payroll needs rules for consistancy and efficiency, please help me with rules ideas

recheck and test adjustments, refine and master: gobal :once off and recurring, employee specific: once off and recurring{
  now i have a question, if an employee have once off adjustment in jan but have 3 executions, but 
  this adjustment if the first execution, how will the code know that? answer the question!
}

security tests
app tests
Row level security implement it (for db im using postgre)
optimize payroll and payments execution adn do it like banks 
do it, be like an engineer, dont include tests in this plan, note system can use postgre based on config, by dfefault it's mysql

optimize payroll and payments execution adn do it like banks do it, note im using postgre db it's no longer mysql, be like an engineer, dont include tests in this plan dont be too ambitious 
focus on current system as it is not like banks but similar, also improve what can be improve be 100% honest and leave what cant be improved by 
code alone, dont strive for perfect system just good enough design for failure, change, and recovery. Correct enough for today
Safe under failure
Evolvable tomorrow
Auditable when things go wrong
Bank-grade systems aren’t “perfect”. They’re:
Immutable instead of fragile
Reversible instead of brittle
Observable instead of magical
Boring instead of clever
That’s why the best systems:
Assume bugs will exist
Assume people will make mistakes
Assume reality will break assumptions

in /payment page when i clickcreate payment i am take to create bonus page, fix that so that im taken to right page - done
when i create payroll with all clicked it gives error empoyees must be seleted - done
payroll dont execute, test again

have one custom alerts used in entire app, alerts, confirm alerts, dont use browser alerts and confirms

make ticket system keep it simple and functional, start from user to admin, make sure when ticket it 
openned admins are emailed, the email is scheduled, utilize postgre -since we are using postgre database use live db changes listeners
to update tickets in real time

make app based notifications it must be simple and sometimes can notify via email

for pricing and billing add one month free trial

payroll and payments dont handle leap years and February, feb ends 28 or 29 next run will be march 30 if i created job in jan 30

make sure no payment and payroll created when escrow balance is 0 and when they shcedule more than they have, 
make it air tight even in database level postgres, even in do checks in executions, make this impossible because 
this is very critical, database we use is postgre, dont overdo it or rplace what exist with no reason, i repeat i only use postgres db
